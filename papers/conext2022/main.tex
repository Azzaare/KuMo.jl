\title{Cloud Morphing: A Feedback Control Model for Distributed Resource Management}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}

In this paper, we envision future distributed cloud services with
abundant heterogeneous computing resources,
and propose a dynamic pricing model as feedback control for
distributed resource management.
In this model, the pseudo cost of a resource is a function of the
load, and the required resources for a job are allocated by a simple
cost minimization algorithm.
This simple mechanism enables automatic load-balancing and
idle-resource pooling within the cloud, and allows operators to
loosely control the utilization of each resource by manipulating the
cost function. We examine different cost tuning methods for adjusting
utilization, and prove the system to be robust against changing
conditions.
