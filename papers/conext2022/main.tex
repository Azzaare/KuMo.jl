\title{Virtualizing Clouds by Cloud Morphing}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}

In this paper, we propose a dynamic pricing model for distributed
resource management in a future distributed cloud.
In this model, the resource cost is a function of the load of the
resource, and the required resources for a job are allocated by a
simple cost minimization algorithm.  This simple mechanism realizes
automatic load balancing within the cloud, and operators can loosely
control the utilization of each resource by manupulating the cost function.
We examine differnt cost tuning methods for adjusting utilization, and
prove the system to be robust against changing conditions.
