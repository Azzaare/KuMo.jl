\title{Cloud Morphing: A Responsive Model for Distributed Resource Management}

\begin{document}


\begin{abstract}

    In this paper, we envision future distributed cloud services with
    abundant heterogeneous computing resources,
    and propose to apply dynamic pricing to a responsive model for
    distributed resource management.
    In this model, the pseudo cost of a resource is a function of the
    load, and the required resources for a job are allocated by a simple
    cost minimization algorithm.
    We introduce a convex cost function that enables autonomous
    load-balancing and idle-resource pooling within the cloud, and allows
    stakeholders to loosely control the utilization of each resource by
    manipulating the cost function or the resource weights of micro-jobs.
    We examine different cost tuning methods for adjusting
    utilization, and illustrate their behaviors by simulation.
