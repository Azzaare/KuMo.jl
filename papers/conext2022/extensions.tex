The basic resource management model has been presented.
But there exists a rich area for further research, as well as
necessary solutions for building a working prototype system.

      \item[Model Refinement]  bidirectional links, multiple users per job,
            interactions among jobs, etc.

      \item[Hierarchical Configurations]
            rack-level.  datacenter level.

      \item[Inter-cloud]
            hierarchical model naturally extends to inter-cloud model.
            The mechanism of the idle resource pooling allows utilizing external
            clouds when only needed.

      \item[Data Migration]
            The location of data is critical.
            A possible approach is to migrate data at coarser timescale, based
            on usage history.
            Another possibility is design a new distributed file system in which
            (cached) data can be easily moved.

      \item[L2 Paths] It is possible to use idle resource pooling for dynamically
            creating L2 paths.

      \item[Resource discovery and cost exchange protocols]
            \cite{Albrecht2008}.

      \item[routing] SRv6?
