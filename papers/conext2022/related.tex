Resource allocation for Edge Computing or Micro Data Centers:
Most approaches use some form of optimization and many employ auction
models.
Zhang {\em et al.}~\cite{Xu2017-zenith,Zhang2017-VMauction}
proposed an online primal-dual optimization for VM auction in IaaS
clouds for wellfare and profit maximization.
The work by Xu {\em et al.}~\cite{Xu2017-zenith} is similar to ours in
separating the cloud infrastructure service from the cloud service for
micro dataceners, but a auction model is proposed for resource
allocation.
Distributed resource management for micro services~\cite{Suresh-SOA-SOCC2017}.

Congestion pricing for networking:
congestion pricing and smart data pricing have been
studied~\cite{pricing-internet-1994,Kelly-1998,gibbens1999resource,Henderson2001,Sen-2013}.
a dynamic pricing model for QoS was implemented by the
Market Managed Multiservice Internet (M3I) project~\cite{Briscoe2003-M3I}.
for cloud computing services\cite{Wang-hotcloud2010,Kilcioglu-SIGMETRICS2015},
for cloud computing spot instances\cite{Song-INFOCOM2017}.
a genetic algorithm is used in\cite{Macias-SAC2011}.

Wagner {\em et al.}~\cite{Wagner-2012} developed a Nash
Bargainingâ€“based congestion pricing mechanism in a military network
setting to distribute jobs across multiple computing clusters for fair
load balancing while using redundancy in job replication to provide
reliability. The goals of manageability, complexity, and
implementability can also conflict; measures to make network traffic
manageable usually introduce some system complexity and implementation
challenges.

load balancing within a data center\cite{Rikhtegar2021BiTEAD}.

pricing used for load-balancing in clouds\cite{Song-2014,Ren-2017}.

Exponential cost growth as a function of load is well known in packet
switching networks (e.g., M/M/1 queue and CSMA/CD Ethernet).
We have modified it to make it convex for idle resource pooling, and
exploit it as the pseudo cost function.
