Resource allocation for Edge Computing or Micro Data Centers: auction models\cite{Xu2017-zenith,Zhang2017-VMauction},
Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs)\cite{Suresh-SOA-SOCC2017}.
Most approaches use some form of optimization.

congestion pricing\cite{gibbens1999resource,Henderson2001}.
a dynamic pricing model for QoS\cite{Briscoe2003-M3I},
for cloud computing services\cite{Wang-hotcloud2010,Kilcioglu-SIGMETRICS2015},
for cloud computing spot instances\cite{Song-INFOCOM2017}.
a genetic algorithm is used in\cite{Macias-SAC2011}.

load balancing within a data center\cite{Rikhtegar2021BiTEAD}.

pricing used for load-balancing in clouds\cite{Song-2014,Ren-2017}.

Exponential cost growth as a function of load is well known in packet
switching networks (e.g., M/M/1 queue and CSMA/CD Ethernet).
We have modified it to make it convex for idle resource pooling, and
exploit it as the pseudo cost function.

data migration\cite{Pu2015-geodistdata}.
distributed data store\cite{Shima2012,Tahoe-2008}.
