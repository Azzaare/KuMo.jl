Simulation settings
\begin{itemize}
\item		job: mean duration:10sec, mean 3 containers,
  mean frontend 30 Mbps, mean backend 60 Mbps
\item		node: capacity 30 containers
\item		link: capacity 1000Mbps
\item		user: mean job request: 1/20 job/sec
\item		data: 1 data object/job (for simplicity)
\item		simulate: 100 users for 1000 sec on topology in Figure \ref{fig:topology-simple}.
\item		users and data objects are randomly assigned to nodes.
\end{itemize}

Simulation scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	{\bf node only:} 4 nodes without randamization to show how the
  cost function works
\item	{\bf link only:} 4 links without randamization to show
  different costs affects
\item	{\bf monotonic function:} same as above but use monotonic cost
  function.
\item	{\bf randamize:} 4 nodes and 4 links with randomization
\item	{\bf surge:} same as above but with a request surge at one location
\item	{\bf complex?:} realistic scenario
\end{enumerate}
